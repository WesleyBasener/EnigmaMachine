# EnigmaMachine
Just an Enigma Cipher project. It uses the historic rotors. Right now I only have Enigma I. But I plan to add Enigma II.

My program allows you to create your machine like some N@ZI build-a-bear workshop. You can select three rotors and and reflector, all written to their historical specifications. Lastly, you can add plugboard settings.

Once finished, you can encode individual characters, updating the machine as you go. This process is painfully inefficient and slow. But this is because the German machine was painfully inefficient and slow. You had to code messages one character at a time.

For some cool math behind how it was cracked, see this lecture:
